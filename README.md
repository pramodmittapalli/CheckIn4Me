CheckIn4Me (formerly a school project) is an in-development Android application for checking-in on multiple location-based services from within one application.
Currently, Foursquare and Gowalla check-ins are supported.  In the future, the goal is to have other services working, such as
Yelp, Brightkite, Facebook Places, and/or SCVNGR.

Below are some screenshots of the application.
